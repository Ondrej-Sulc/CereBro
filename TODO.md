# TODO

- possibly add buttons in the /help command to go try some of the commands
- propper dev enviroment with dev DB, will have to duplicate db I guess
    - separate some tables into a different database. seperate tables that are environment dependent and static data (champions data thats same for both ?)
    - using admin / debug commands only in dev version of bot
- handle pagination in schedule view for 40+ components
- reduce /profile commands, add interactive stuff (Done)
- alternate screenshot roster processing (different view in game, from the battlegrouds roster, which also includes sig levels. generaly includes more details but doesnt have champion names, we would rely only on image processing to diferentiate champions)
- In the AQ tracker, disable buttons after they are clicked.
    - investigate AQ tracker sending, its not working properly.
- Clean up enable feature command, not used anymore
- update AW details command to take data from DB if not already
