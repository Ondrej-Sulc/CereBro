# TODO

- possibly add buttons in the /help command to go try some of the commands
- Alliance management, players etc
    - search for a champion across alliance roster
- propper dev enviroment with dev DB, will have to duplicate db I guess
    - separate some tables into a different database. seperate tables that are environment dependent and static data (champions data thats same for both ?)
    - using admin / debug commands only in dev version of bot
- schedule view handle pagination for 40+ components
- reduce /profile commands, add interactive stuff (halfway done)
- improve ux with the roster update command (maybe a clickable link to prefill the command to add more champions)
  - alternative way to upload roster through web UI. (implemented but UX needs to be improved, copy paste images, not just drag and drop. Visual feedback of what was detected).
  - alternate screenshot roster processing (different view in game, from the battlegrouds roster, which also includes sig levels. generaly includes more details but doesnt have champion names, we would rely only on image processing to diferentiate champions)
- In the AQ tracker, disable buttons after they are clicked.
    - investigate AQ tracker sending, it not working properly.
- Website upgrades, add a propper showcase for the main features.
- Alliance War statistics in web UI.
    - per season.
- Your Roster view on website?
- Prestige history graph
- AW planning
    - [DONE] rework the background on the map, improve it visually, there should be no visible edge of the map background
    - [DONE] limit zoom out maybe? (currently it lets me zoom out a lot so the map is just a very tiny part of the screen)
    - implement generating images from the map for sending with war plans, map version for each player with their highlighted fights on the map
    - when sending plans, create player threads if they dont exist
    - while planning, optimize data fetching from db with caching (stuff that is persistent, like champion data), I see too many db queries in the background.
- Create discord support server
